thinking why would anyone create a website to help people.. and what would make someone help another person .. came up with one answer : (ETHAR).

What is ETHAR?
Is to give and get in return .. because No one has ever become poor by giving. __ Anne Frank

Why this website?
{"No one is useless in this world who lightens the burdens of another.” }.
{“When we give cheerfully and accept gratefully, everyone is blessed.” }.

THIS WEBSITE ... How it's gonna make an affect on the community ?
Mother Teresa once said : "IF YOU CAN'T FEED A HUNDRED PEOPLE THEN FEED JUST ONE".

by helping an individual You make a difference in the community, and BTW 
You don't need a reason to help people .. You only need to be  A human.
