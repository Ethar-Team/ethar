                A voluntary community service that aims to meet the needs of some categories of poor societies. Our idea
                is to exchange people for what they need. Also, to deposit more than their needs in terms of supplies
                that can benefit and save others, and to spread and strengthen the values of cooperation and altruism in
                society through correctional services from competent persons and volunteers who are friendly in
                participation.
